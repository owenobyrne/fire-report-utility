        needed. See the [Guide to Authentication](/docs/authentication) for full
        details.

        As the customer goes through the process of making the payment the
        status of the payment will change.


        * `AWAITING_AUTHORISATION` -This is the initial status of all your
        payments.

        * `AWAITING_MULTI_AUTHORISATION` - Some business accounts such as
        charities require dual authorisation.

        * `NOT_AUTHORISED` - Either your customer clicked on cancel or the
        payment was rejected by their ASPSP / bank.

        * `PENDING` - This is the status that your payment is set to after the
        customer has authorised the payment with their ASPSP / bank but the bank
        may want to carry out another check before funding the transaction.

        * `AUTHORISED` - This is the status that your payment is set to after
        the customer has authorised the payment with their ASPSP / bank.

        * `PAID` - Funds were received into your fire.com GBP or EUR account
        from your customer’s ASPSP / bank.

        use this endpoint.


        As your customer goes through the payment submission journey, the
        payment status will change. The endpoint will return one of the
        following statuses:


        * `AWAITING_AUTHORISATION` - This is the initial status of all payments,
        indicating that the user has consented to be directed to their
        ASPSP/Bank's application. Payments remaining at this status may be
        considered abandoned.

        * `AWAITING_MULTI_AUTHORISATION` - Some business accounts require dual
        authorisation for payments.

        * `NOT_AUTHORISED` - This is a final status, and indicates that the
        payment initiation was cancelled by the customer, rejected by the
        ASPSP/Bank, an error response returned by the ASPSP/Bank, eg. low
        balance in the customers account.

        * `PENDING` - The customer has authorised the payment in their app, but
        their ASPSP/bank may want to carry out an internal check before funding
        the transaction.

        * `AUTHORISED` - The payment is successfully initiated, having been
        authorised by your customer and their ASPSP/Bank.


        Once the payment is successfully initiated, ie. `AUTHORISED`, the
        ASPSP/Bank should settle the funds, which are then applied to your Fire
        account.


        * `FUNDS_CONFIRMED` - This status is currently available for GBP
        payments only. The payment has been received by Fire and will be applied
        to your account in the next file run.

        * `SETTLED` - This is a final status, indicating that funds have been
        applied to your Fire GBP or EUR account.

      summary: Add a Bank Transfer to a Batch
      description: >
        There are two ways to process bank transfers - by Payee ID (**Mode 1**)
        or by Payee Account Details (**Mode 2**).


        **Mode 1:** Use the payee IDs of existing approved payees set up against
        your account. These batches can be approved in the normal manner.


        **Mode 2:** Use the account details of the payee. In the event that
        these details correspond to an existing approved payee, the batch can be
        approved as normal. If the account details are new, a batch of New
        Payees will automatically be created. This batch will need to be
        approved before the Payment batch can be approved. These payees will
        then exist as approved payees for future batches.
